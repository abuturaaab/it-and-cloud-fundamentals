# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## Definition and Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing

### Cloud computing (NIST)

A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Examples of computing resources include:
- Networks
- Servers
- Applications
- Services

### Cloud model

- 5 Essential characteristics
- 3 Deployment models
- 3 Service models

#### 5 Essential characteristics

- **Cloud Computing as a Service**

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230218101306.png)

#### 3 Types of cloud deployment models

1) Public
2) Hybrid
3) Private

#### 3 Service models

Three layers in a computing stack:
1) Infrastructure (IaaS)
2) Platform (PaaS)
3) Application (SaaS)

## History and Evolution of Cloud Computing

In the 1950s:
- Large-scale mainframes with high-volume processing power.
- The practice of time-sharing, or resource pooling, evolved.
- Multiple users were able to access the same data storage layer and CPU power.

In the 1970s:
- Virtual Machine (VM)
- Mainframes to have multiple virtual systems, or virtual machines, on a single physical node

### Cloud: Switch from CapEx to OpEx

## Key Considerations for Cloud Computing

### Key Drivers for moving to cloud

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230218102318.png)

#### Infrastructure and Workloads

- The cost of building and operating data centers can become astronomical.
- Low initial costs and pay-as-you-go attributes of cloud computing can add up to significant cost savings.

#### SaaS and development platforms

- Organizations need to consider if paying for application access is a more viable option than purchasing off-the-shelf software and subsequently investing in upgrades

#### Speed and Productivity

- Organizations also need to consider what it means to them to get a new application up and running in ‘x’ hours on the cloud versus a couple of weeks, even months on traditional platforms.
- Also, the person-hour cost efficiencies increases from using cloud dashboards, real-time statistics, and active analytics.

#### Risk Exposure

- Organizations need to consider the impact of making a wrong decision – their risk exposure.
- Is it safer for an organization to work on a 12-month plan to build, write, test, and release the code if they’re certain about adoption?
- And is it better for them to “try” something new paying-as-you-go rather than making long-term decisions based on little or no trial or adoption?

### Benefits of cloud adoption

- Flexibility
- Efficiency
- Strategic Value

### Challenges of cloud adoption

- Data security, associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption
- Governance and sovereignty issues
- Legal, regulatory, and compliance issues
- Lack of standardization in how the constantly evolving technologies integrate and interoperate
- Choosing the right deployment and service models to serve specific needs
- Partnering with the right cloud service providers
- Concerns related to business continuity and disaster recovery

# Business Case for Cloud Computing

## Cloud Adoption – No longer a choice

- It is no longer a thing of the future
- Single individual to Global multi-billion dollar enterprise, anybody can access the computing capacity they need on the cloud.

Cloud makes it possible for businesses to:
- Experiment
- Fail 
- Learn
Faster than ever before with low risk.

- Businesses today have greater freedom to change course than to live with the consequences of expensive decisions taken in the past.
- To remain, competitive, businesses need to be able to respond quickly to marketplace changes.
- Product lifecycles have shortened, and barriers to entry have become lower.
- The power, scalability, flexibility, and pay-as-you-go economics of cloud has made it underpinning foundation for digital transformation.
