# Network Topologies, Types, and Connections

# Types and Topologies

### What is a computer network?

Computer networking refers to connected computing devices and an array of IoT devices that communicate with one another.

### Network Types

There are multiple network types:
- PAN (Personal Area Network)
- LAN (Local Area Network)
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- WAN (Wide Area Network)
- WLAN (Wireless LAN)
- VPN (Virtual Private Network)

#### PAN (Personal Area Network)

A PAN enables communication between devices around a person. PANs can be wired or wireless.
- USB
- FireWire
- Infrared
- ZigBee
- Bluetooth

#### LAN (Local Area Network)

A LAN is typically limited to a small, localized area, such as a single building or site.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230220093307.png)

#### MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

- A MAN is a network that spans an entire city, a campus, or a small region.
- MANs are sometimes referred to as CANs (Campus Area Networks).

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230220093518.png)

#### WAN (Wide Area Network)

A WAN is a network that extends over a large geographic area.
- Businesses
- Schools
- Government entities

#### WLAN (Wireless LAN)

A WLAN links two or more devices using wireless communication.
- Home
- School
- Campus
- Office building
- Computer Lab

**Through a gateway device, a WLAN can also provide a connection to the wider Internet.**

#### VPN (Virtual Private Network)

- A private network connection across public networks.
- Encrypt your Internet traffic.
- Disguise your online identity
- Safeguard your data.

### Topology

- Topology defines a network’s structure
- A network’s topology type is chosen bases on the specific needs of the group installing that network

1) **Physical Topology**: It describes how network devices are physically connected.
2) **Logical Topology**: It describes how data flows across the physically connected network devices.

#### Star topology

Star topology networks feature a central computer that acts as a hub.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230220094631.png)

#### Ring topology

Ring topology networks connect all devices in a circular ring pattern, where data only flows in one direction (clockwise).

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230220094843.png)

#### Bus topology

Bus topology networks connect all devices with a single cable or transmission line.
- Small networks, LAN.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230220094942.png)

#### Tree topology

Tree topology networks combine the characteristics of bus topology and star topology.
- University campus

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230220095221.png)

#### Mesh topology

Mesh topology networks connect all devices on the network together.
- This is called dynamic routing.
- It is commonly used in WAN network for backup purposes.
- It is not used in LAN implementations.

### Newer Internet Connection Types

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230220095659.png)

### Wired Networks

Wired networking refers to the use of wire connections that allow users to communicate over a network.

- Most computer networks still depend on cables or wires to connect devices and transfer data.

#### Wire Connections: DSL

Connects to the Internet using a modem and two copper wires within the phone lines to receive and transmit data.

**Pros**:
- Faster than dial-up
- Inexpensive
- Dedicated connection (no bandwidth sharing)
- Can provide Wi-Fi
- Uses existing phone lines

**Cons**:
- Slow speeds (less than 100 Mbps)
- Not always available

#### Wired Connections: Cable

Cable delivers Internet via copper coaxial television cable.

**Pros**:
- Lower cost than fiber
- Fast speeds
- Better than DSL
- Long distances
- Lower latency

**Cons**:
- Bandwidth congestion
- Slower uploads
- Electromagnetic interference

#### Wired Connection: Fiber Optic

Transmit data by sending pulses of light across strands of glass (up to 200 Gbps).

**Pros**:
- Efficient
- Reliable
- Covers long distances
- Fast speeds
- Streaming and hosting

**Cons**:
- Expensive
- Not available everywhere

## Cables

### Cables types
