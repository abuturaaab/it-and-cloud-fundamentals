# Security Concerns and Safe Browsing

## Application Ecosystem Security

### Mobile applications

- Weak passwords
- Malware
- Poorly designed apps

### Rooting and Jail breaking

- Add functionality but also adds vulnerability

### Desktop Software

- Weak passwords
- Not physically secure
- Non-HTTPS browsing

### Business software

Business software automates transactions, mines sales data, manages information, and more.

### Corporate network

To protect files, systems, and resources, businesses must limit access.

## Public Browsing Risks

### Free and Open networks

### Public browsing risks

- Session hijacking
- Shoulder surfing

### Social Networking Sites

### Instant messaging

### Internet browser and versions

### Browser Security Settings

### Cookies

Cookies are text files with small pieces of data.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230221165718.png)

Cookie types:
- Session cookies
- Persistent cookies
- Authentication cookies
- First-party cookies
- Third-party cookies
- Zombie cookies

### Security certificates

Secure sockets layer (SSL) certificates authenticate a website’s identity and enable an encrypted connection between a web server and a browser.

### Browser updates

Because browsers are a favorite target for hackers, keeping them updated is very important.

## Safe Browsing Techniques

### Autofill management

### Browser cache and history

A browser cache is a storage data that holds downloads of web pages you’ve visited.

### Private browsing

- You appear as a new or unknown user on the sites you visit.
- Other people who use the device won’t see your history.
- Cookies and site data are deleted when you exit the browser.
- But private browsing activity isn’t hidden from your employer, school, or ISP.
- Bookmarks you create will be kept.
- Downloaded files are saved and may be visible to other users.

### Malicious websites

### Safe websites

Identifying safe websites is more significant than ever.

Safety tips include:
- Use the Whois Lookup tool
- Look for reviews
- Only visit HTTPS sites
- Check the trust seal
- Inspect URLs

### Adware and popups

### Redirection

The aim of redirection is to point you towards certain types of advertising or dangerous code.

Redirection is caused by:
- Unwanted toolbars or browser extensions
- Malware that alerts searches and URLs
- Hacked websites servers that redirect visitors

To avoid hijacking and redirection:
- Set automatic updates for your browser, OS, and security tools.
- Run regular system scans.

### Warning signs

Search engines use algorithms to detect harmful sites. Browsers use those results to warn users.

## Security Threats: Virtual Private Networks

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230221172535.png)

VPN types:
- Site-to-site VPN
- Host-to-site VPN
- Host-to-host VPN

### VPN hardware

VPN hardware devices are:
- Devices specifically designed to create VPNs
- Network devices with added VPN functionality

### Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)

IPsec is a suite of network standards and protocols that use cryptography to protect data traveling over the Internet.

IPsec suite core protocols:
1) IPsec Authentication Header (AH) protocol
	- Authenticates senders and IP addresses
1) Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol
	- Encrypts data
	- Authenticates data and senders

The IPsec suite has two modes:

The IPsec suite uses:
