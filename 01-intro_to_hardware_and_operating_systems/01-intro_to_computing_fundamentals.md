## Understanding How Computers Talk

### Notational systems defined

A system of symbols that represent types of numbers.

### Notational systems – decimal

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230116144250.png)

### Notational systems – binary

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230116144355.png)

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230116144516.png)

### Convert to decimal to binary

 ![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230116144650.png)

### Convert binary to decimal

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230116144804.png)

### Notational Systems – hexadecimal

- Uses 16 digits, referred to as base 16, including the numbers <ins>0</ins> through <ins>9</ins>, and the letters <ins>A</ins> through <ins>F</ins>.
- Enables compact notation for large numbers
- Used for **MAC** addresses, colors, IP addresses, and memory addresses

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230206121207.png)

### Convert hex to binary

1) Note the hex number, and represent each hex digit by its binary equivalent number.
2) Add insignificant zeros if the binary number has less than 4 digits. For example, write the decimal **10** as **0010**.
3) String (concatenate) all the binary digits together from left to right.
4) Discard any leading zeros at the left of the concatenated number.

**The result is 100100011010.**

### Data Types

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230206122044.png)

### Character Types

#### ASCII

American Standard Code for Information Interchange:

	+ Developed from telegraph code and first published in 1963.
	+ Translates computer text to human text.
	+ Originally a 7-byte system (to save on transmission costs) representing 128 binary character.
	+ Expanded to 8-bytes representing another 256 characters.
	+ Full charts are available online.

#### Unicode

Unicode includes ASCII and other characters from languages around the world, as well as emojis.

	+ Web pages use UTF-8.
	+ Popular programming languages use Unicode 16-bit encoding and a few use 32-bit.
	+ Commonly formatted as **U+hhhh**, known as "code points", where **hhhh** is character hexadecimal value.
	+ Conversion services are available online.

## An Introduction to Operating Systems

 ### Operating system basics

Operating systems consist of standardized code for:

**Input>Output>Processing>Storage**

- CLI
- GUI

### Operating system history

 ![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230206133349.png)

#### The first generation (1945-1955)

- Operating systems that worked for multiple computers didn't yet exist.
- All input, output, processing, and storage instructions were coded every time, for every task.
- This repetitive code became the basis for future operating systems.

#### The second generation (1955-1965)

- Mainframe computers became available for commercial and scientific use.
- Tape drives provided input and output storage.
- In 1956, GM Research produced the first single-stream batch operating system for its IBM 704 computing system.
- IBM became the first company to create OSes to accompany computers.
- Embedded operating systems were developed in the early 1960s and are still in use.
		+ Focus on a single task.
		+ Provide split-second response times.
		+ Real-time operating systems are a type of embedded operating system used in **airplanes and air traffic control**, **space exploration**.
		+ As the time passed, real-time OSes started being used in **satellite systems, Robotics, Cars/automobiles**.

#### The third generation (1965-1980)

- Additional companies began creating their own batch file operating systems for their large computing needs.
- Network operating systems were developed during this time.
		+ Provide scalable, fast, accurate, and secure network communications.
		+ Enables workstations to operate independently.
- In 1969, the UNIX operating system, operable on multiple computer systems, featured processor time-sharing.

#### The fourth generation (1980 to now)

- **Multitasking operating systems** enable computers to perform multiple tasks at the same time.
	- Linux
		- 1991: Linus Torvalds created a small, open source PC operating system.
		- 1994: Version 1.0 released.
		- 1996: Version 2.0 released, included support for network-based SMP benefitting commercial and scientific data processing.
		- 2013: Google's Linux-based mobile operating system, Android, took 75% of the mobile operating system market share.
		- 2018: IBM acquired Red Hat for $34 billion.
	- macOS
		- 1999: OS X and macOS, based on UNIX, offered with PowerPC with PowerPC-based Macs.
		- 2006: Apple began selling Macs using Intel Core processors.
		- 2020: Apple began the Apple Silicon chip transition, using self-designed 64-bit, ARM-based Apple M1 processors on new Mac computers.
	- Windows
		- 1981: MS-DOS launched
		- 1985: Launched a graphical user interface version of the Windows operating system.
		- 1995: Windows 95 catapulted Microsoft's dominance in the consumer operating system software market.
		- Today, Microsoft holds about 70% of consumer desktop operating system market share.
		- Microsoft also offers network, server management, mobile, and phone operating systems.
	- ChromeOS
		- 2011: Launched ChromeOS built atop Linux.
		- Offers a lightweight operating system built for mobile devices.
		- Requires less local storage and costs less.
		- Currently composes about 10% of the laptop market.

- **Mobile operating systems** also fit the definition of multitasking operating systems.
	- Android
	- iOS
	- Windows
