## Managing File and Folders

### Rules for naming files and folders

- Name so the file or folder you want is easy to find
- Make names short but descriptive
- Use 25 characters or fewer
- Avoid using special characters
- Use capitals and underscores
- Consider using a date format

## Evaluating Computing Performance and Storage

### Assessing processor performance

- The processor’s speed
- The number of cores
- The bus types and speeds
	- Located on the processor’s perimeter
	- The data highway wiring from the processor to other board components
- The presence of cache or other onboard memory

#### Bus types

Historically, three bus types:

#### Bus alternatives

Replacement technologies include:

And others.

### Cache

- Consist of processor platform memory that buffers information and speeds tasks
- Can help offset slower processor speeds

### Storage

### RAM error symptoms

- Screen or computer freezes or stops working
- Computer runs more slowly
- Browser tabs error or other error messages display
- Out-of-memory or other error messages display
- Files become corrupt
- Computer beeps
- A “blue screen” with an error message displays

## Workstation Evaluation and Setup

### Identifying user needs

Environment: Where does the use work?

What are the user’s workspace conditions?

### Purchasing decisions

Four important considerations:

### Workstation setup

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230213151110.png)

#### Environment

- Is a desk present or needed? If so, is the desk safe and sturdy?
- Is a chair present? If so, is the chair safe and sturdy?
- Is lighting present?
- Are electrical outlets present, of appropriate amperage and grounded?
- Can the use physically secure the computer?

#### Unboxing

- Read and follow the manufacturer’s practices for workstation setup
- Move boxes and packing materials into a safe location, out of the user’s workspace

#### Cable management

Reduce service calls with three practices
- Install shorter cable lengths where possible
- Securely attach and identify each cable
- Collect and tie the cables together

#### Electrical

Safety for you and your user:
- Label each electric cable.
- Verify that electrical connections are away from the user and are accessible.
- Connect power supplies to their assigned wall or power strip location. Note the wall outlet number.

#### Ergonomics

Can the user work comfortably?
- Feet are on the floor.
- Monitor at or just below eye height.
- Arms are parallel with the keyboard, table, and chair.
- Shoulders are relaxed and not hunched.
- The environment provides enough light to see the display and keyboard.
- Cords and cables are out of the way.

#### Workstation setup

- Power on the workstation and peripherals
- Setup the operating system and options for the user:
	- User logon credentials
	- Keyboard options
	- Monitor resolution
	- Printer connections
	- Sound options
	- Security options
	- Network connections
- Select the user’s default browser
- Uninstall bloatware or unnecessary software
- Install and configure additional productivity software
- Modify the desktop Productivity pane
- Setup backup options
